      <h1>STEAM</h1>
      <p>Steam is a video game digital distribution service by Valve. 
        It was launched as a standalone software client in September 2003 as a way for Valve to provide automatic updates for their games, 
        and expanded to include games from third-party publishers. Steam has also expanded into an online web-based and mobile digital storefront. 
        Steam offers digital rights management (DRM), matchmaking servers, video streaming,
        and social networking services. It also provides the user with installation and automatic updating of games,
        and community features such as friends lists and groups, cloud saving, and in-game voice and chat functionality. <br>
        The software provides a freely available application programming interface (API) called Steamworks, 
        which developers can use to integrate many of Steam's functions into their products, 
        including matchmaking, in-game achievements, microtransactions, 
        and support for user-created content through Steam Workshop. 
        Though initially developed for use on Microsoft Windows operating systems, 
        versions for macOS and Linux were later released. Mobile apps were also released for iOS, Android, 
        and Windows Phone in the 2010s. The platform also offers a small selection of other content, including design software, hardware, 
        game soundtracks, anime, and films.</p>

      <h1>GRAB</h1>
      <p>Grab Holdings Inc., commonly known as Grab, is a multinational ride-hailing company based in Singapore.
        In addition to transportation, the company offers food delivery and digital payments services via a mobile app. 
        It now operates in the Southeast and East Asian countries of Singapore, Japan, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, 
        Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. It is the region's first "decacorn" (a startup with a valuation of over US$10 billion). <br>
        The Grab app assigns taxis and private hire cars to nearby commuters through a location-sharing system. 
        Each time the company enters a new market, they buy smartphones for drivers in countries that they expand to, 
        allowing those drivers to pay daily instalments for the phone.[15] The company makes money by taking a cut of the booking fees.
        Although some taxi companies have tried to stop their own drivers from using the app, 
        Grab reached out directly to taxi drivers by signing them up at airports, hawker centres, taxi queues, and depots.
        The company also educates taxi drivers on using the smartphone and their mobile app. In addition to large cities, 
        Grab has also tried to penetrate the markets of smaller cities.</p>
